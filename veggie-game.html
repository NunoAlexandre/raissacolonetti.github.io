<p>Children go through a set of levels and need to perform tasks, such as moving in different ways, while developing their gross motor skills. Their reward within the game is connected to showing the health benefits of eating vegetables and it is an effective way to motivate children to discover more about them.</p>

Sounds, visuals, words, movements and animations in the game are suitable for preschoolers.
