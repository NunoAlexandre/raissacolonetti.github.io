    <p>
      I am a junior product and graphic designer based in The Hague, Netherlands. 
      I studied Industrial Design Engineering at The Hague University of Applied Sciences between 2014 and 2018. 
      When designing I apply industrial design methodology in order to create innovative solutions for both digital and product design. 
      My work experience is broad and covers industrial, digital, game and UX design.
    </p>
    <p>As far as my personality goes, I can say that I am an open-minded, inspiring, visionary and creative person.</p>
    <p>Let’s work together!</p>
